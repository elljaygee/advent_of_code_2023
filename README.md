# advent_of_code_2023

working on this solely for my own learning!   
my skill level isn't up to a lot of the challenges so if i can't figure it out in a day or two i'm researching other solutions.
solutions from other players will be credited with their info (eg. Reddit username) with comments added by me as i work through them and understand how each solution works so that i have code examples for future reference.
